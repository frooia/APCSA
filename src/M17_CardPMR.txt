<+s> This project had very clear instructions for how to write the methods and constructors.
<-s> At first I did not understand how the suit array worked, and only later did I realize that all the 
ranks of cards had to be initialized for each suit.

In the future: I will follow the program instructions and specifications closely to accomplish the task.
