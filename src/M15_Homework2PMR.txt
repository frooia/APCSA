************************************************** P M R **************************************************
<+s> This project was based off a pre-existing program, so I did not have to write new code.
<-s> Organizing the different interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes was confusing.
***********************************************************************************************************
In the future: I would work on planning the structure of a program before writing code to prevent confusion
when writing classes and methods.
