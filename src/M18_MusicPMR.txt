<+s> This project was easy to understand, since sequential searching is very simple. Returning multiple 
results from a search was also not hard.
<-s> I had to declare all the song objects anew, which took some time because I had to search for songs.

In the future: I will use sequential search for short lists which do not take long to traverse through.
