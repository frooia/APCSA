<+s> I used a lot of the code provided within the lesson to do the project, so I only had to write the new 
classes that I made.
<-s> The many classes made with the hierarchical structure was a bit messy to organize on my computer.
***********************************************************************************************************
In the future: I would find a better organizational structure for the many classes that I have to make.
