************************************************** P M R **************************************************
<+s> I was able to create a program of my own liking, and the instructions allowed freedom to create any
program as long as it used several methods and a default constructor.
<-s> Making a class diagram seemed extra, since my program was not too complex.
***********************************************************************************************************
In the future: I would use class diagrams for complicated programs to outline the methods and variables.
