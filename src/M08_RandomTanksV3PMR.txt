************************************************** P M R **************************************************
<+s> Using arrays for objects was very similar to using arrays for other data types.
<-s> Combining algorithms for printing, calculating minimums, maximums, and averages was time consuming.
***********************************************************************************************************
In the future: I would use arrays to iterate through a list, since it is simpler than referring to objects
one by one.
